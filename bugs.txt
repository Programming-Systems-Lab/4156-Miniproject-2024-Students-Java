Here I will list all the bugs that I found in the project and how I solve it.

# In Course class:
1. `return enrollmentCapacity > enrolledStudentCount;`
    - Address: In isCourseFull() method in Course class.
    - Solution: Change the > to <.
    - Reason: The mothod should return false when the enrolledStudentCount is greater than or equal to the enrollmentCapacity.

2. `return this.instructorName;`
    - Address: In getCourseLocation() method in Course class.
    - Solution: Change instructorName to courseLocation.
    - Reason: The method should return the courseLocation, not the instructorName.

3. `return this.courseLocation;`
    - Address: In getInstructorName() method in Course class.
    - Solution: Change courseLocation to instructorName.
    - Reason: The method should return the instructorName, not the courseLocation.

# In Department class:
1. `return -this.numberOfMajors;`
    - Address: In getNumberOfMajors() method in Department class.
    - Solution: Remove the - sign.
    - Reason: The method should return the number of majors, not the negative number of majors.

2. `return "result.toString()";`
    - Address: In toString() method in Department class.
    - Solution: change it to return result.toString();
    - Reason: The method should return the result of the toString() method, not the string "result.toString()".

3. `return "this.departmentChair";`
    - Address: In getDepartmentChair() method in Department class.
    - Solution: Change it to return this.departmentChair;
    - Reason: The method should return the departmentChair, not the string "this.departmentChair".
