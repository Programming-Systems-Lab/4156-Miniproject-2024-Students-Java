# Welcome Potential 4156 Leaders

This repository contains the mini project that we anticipate to be given to 
students in the upcoming fall semester. 

Your job is to complete the assignments as specified by the assignment specs in the 
<code> Assignment Specifications</code> folder in the repository. There are multiple people 
potentially attempting to complete these assignments so you MUST make a new branch for all the 
changes you intend to make. DO NOT modify the main branch. 

The instructions mention forking but this is replaced by you making your own branches so 
disregard that portion of the instructions. 

The submissions you provide along with any comments you make will up us to amend the project 
prior to presenting it next semester. If you have any CRITICAL questions while completing this 
(i.e. you have 0 clue what something is asking you to do and are unable to parse it) Please 
email me at: <code>gcn2106+4156@columbia.edu</code> and I will get back to you, any other 
noncritical comments please save until after.

I will be using your solutions to draft the rubric and if I feel the submission you have 
provided is good enough then I will endorse your application to be a student leader. If this 
does not happen then I still wish for you to take the course! It is really a crucial course for 
those planning to become Software Engineers.

Just like normal students you must abide by all honesty procedures as laid out in the 
specifications. Being a leader doesn't make you above the rules, if anything just the opposite 
it puts you in the spotlight and you must set a proper example for your fellow students. 

I wish you the best of luck in completing this and any and all future endeavors you have!

Best wishes,

Griffin N
