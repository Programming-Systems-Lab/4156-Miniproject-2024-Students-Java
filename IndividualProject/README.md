For this project, I used the IntelliJ PMD plugin to check for and resolve static code analysis issues 
(performence ruleset in default and secuirty ruleset). Additionally, subsequent pull requests (PRs) 
were made and merged into the main branch to address bugs and improve code quality based on the PMD feedback.
