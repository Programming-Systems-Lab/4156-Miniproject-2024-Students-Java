1. enrollStudent returned false when it could enroll students within a course. Also, enrollStudent doesn’t check if the capacity of the class is hit
2. dropStudent originally returned false but it should check if the actual variable’s value has decreased, then return the appropriate boolean value
3. isCourseFull should be checking if student count is equal to capacity
4. There’s no way to check the course’s current enrollmentAmount ????
5. getCourseLocation() was grabbing the instructorName instead of courseLocation, silly mistake :P
6. getInstructorName() was grabbing the courseLocation instead of instructor's name, :PP
7.
