Bugs:
Course:
1. Enrolled student count defaults to 500 in constructor
2. Getter functions between instructor and location have swapped functionality
3. IsCourseFull returns true when student count is less than capacity, instead of other way around
4. Conditions for enroll student and drop student are incorrect, do not check course capacity first

Department:
1. Incorrect return type for some getters
2. Incorrect check for dropPersonFromMajor()
3. Added this when referencing class variables for conciseness

RouteController:
1. Some incorrect https return codes between OK, FORBIDDEN, and NOT_FOUND
2. Fixed findCourseTime function returning correct time respective to course
