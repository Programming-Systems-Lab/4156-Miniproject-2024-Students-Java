Bugs that I found using PMD:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    LooseCoupling
        - Where: 30+ instances of this error
        - Why: Interface preferred over specified declaration
        - Example: HashMap deptMap = new HashMap... -> Map deptMap = new HashMap...
        - Fixed: Yes, all instances where refactored to Map type instead of HashMap for functionality

    UnnecessaryAnnotationValueElement
        - Where: 17 individual instances
        - Why: syntactically used "value=" where only a single argument presides
        - Example: (@RequestParam(value = "deptCode") String deptCode) -> (@RequestParam("deptCode") String deptCode)
        - Fixed: Yes, all 17 instances have been corrected to ensure convention

    UseLocaleWithCaseConversions
        - Where: RouteController.java:48,RouteController.java:45
        - Why: When doing a String.toLowerCase()/toUpperCase() call, we use a Locale to insure consistency
        - Example: deptCode.toUpperCase() -> deptCode.toUpperCase(Locale.ENGLISH)
        - Fixed: Yes, both instances have been corrected

    Missing Override
        - Where: Department.java:102, Course.java:65
        - Why: Overrides the default toString() that would not suffice for either case do to specific needs outlined
        - Example: @Override toString() {...
        - Fixed: Yes, both refracted, no complications

    LiteralsFirstComparison
        - Where: IndividualProjectApplication.java:41
        - Why: Prevents a null pointer from occurring
        - Example: arg.equals("setup") -> "setup".equals(arg)
        - Fixed: Yes, single instance was corrected

    UnusedLocalVariable:
        - Where: RouteController.java:291
        - Why: This whole method is a mess and the error only begins to explain why. Yes, the variable is
        unused but it actually needs to be in the code. We need this to get the correct timeSlot which wasn't
        being called either (see next error).
        - Example: The absence of requestedCourse.somethingCalledUpon() in this case:
                String courseTime = requestedCourse.getCourseTimeSlot();
        - Fixed: Yes, but only after acknowledgment of the next issue as well

     Logical Error:
        - Where: ""
        - Why: It looks as though someone might have pseudo-coded this method and neglected to replace the temp
        string holding "some time " with real data from the requestedCourse. In this case, the placeholder string
        was replaced with a call on the time slot method.
        - Example: ("The course meets at: " + "some time "... -> "The course meets at: " + timeSlot ...
        - Fixed: Yes, fully functional

    ReturnEmptyCollectionRatherThanNull
        - Where: MyFileDatabase.java:54
        - Why: Incorrect return type
        - Example: return null; -> return HashMap<>();
        - Fixed: Yes, single instance was corrected

    Note: There was one or two bugs I noticed all the way back to "Code Clean Up". These were conspicuous. This
    includes things like returning: return "this.department"; instead of: return this.department; or things like:
    return -this.capacity; instead of: return this.capacity; I have a general example with a specific error
    within the code for all the undocumented changes, each of which fit into one of the several categories above.
