1. Incorrect Initial Value Assignment
Location: Course.java, constructor
Issue: enrolledStudentCount was initialized to 500 instead of 0.
Resolution: Changed the initialization of enrolledStudentCount to 0 to correctly start with no students enrolled in the course.

2. Incorrect Return Values in enrollStudent() and dropStudent() Methods
Location: Course.java, enrollStudent() and dropStudent() methods
Issue: Both methods always returned false instead of indicating the actual success of the operation.
Resolution: Updated enrollStudent() to return true when enrollment is successful (if there is space) and false otherwise. Similarly, dropStudent() was updated to return true when a student is successfully dropped and false if no students are enrolled.

3. Incorrect Return Values in Getter Methods
Location: Course.java, getCourseLocation() and getInstructorName() methods
Issue: getCourseLocation() returned the instructorName, and getInstructorName() returned the courseLocation.
Resolution: Swapped the return values in getCourseLocation() and getInstructorName() to return the correct attributes.

4. Incorrect Condition Check in isCourseFull()
Location: Course.java, isCourseFull() method
Issue: The method returned true when enrollmentCapacity was greater than enrolledStudentCount, which is logically incorrect.
Resolution: Changed the condition to return true when enrolledStudentCount >= enrollmentCapacity, indicating that the course is full.

5. Incorrect Field Reference in getNumberOfMajors()
Location: Department.java, getNumberOfMajors() method
Issue: The method returned -this.numberOfMajors instead of this.numberOfMajors, resulting in a negative count.
Resolution: Changed the return value to this.numberOfMajors to return the correct number of majors.

6. Literal String Return in getDepartmentChair()
Location: Department.java, getDepartmentChair() method
Issue: The method incorrectly returned "this.departmentChair" instead of the actual value of the departmentChair field.
Resolution: Fixed the return value to return this.departmentChair.

7. Incorrect Return Value in toString() Method
Location: Department.java, toString() method
Issue: The method returned a literal "result.toString()" instead of the concatenated StringBuilder result.
Resolution: Changed the return statement to return result.toString(); to return the correctly formatted string representation.

8. Incorrect Response Status in RouteController
Location: RouteController.java, testRetrieveDepartmentFound() and testRetrieveCourseFound()
Issue: The test methods had incorrect expected HTTP status codes in the assertions.
Resolution: Updated the assertions to use the correct expected status codes (HttpStatus.OK for a successful response).

9. Unused Local Variable in findCourseTime()
Location: RouteController.java, findCourseTime() method
Issue: The variable `requestedCourse` was declared but never used, causing an "UnusedLocalVariable" warning in PMD.
Resolution: Removed the redundant `requestedCourse` variable and updated the logic to use the result from `retrieveCourse()` directly.
