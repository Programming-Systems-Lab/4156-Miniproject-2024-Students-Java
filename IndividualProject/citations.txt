As an additional note, this file is not well covered by tests and likely still has a good number of bugs remaining. In all honesty, I've just started a very challenging new job and have only been able to start this assignment tonight. This week was quite challenging in particular. With that being said, I imagine the next few months will be less intense on average and will have more time to allocate to future projects.

I was able to complete fixing the files for style issues, write some test coverage, as well as fix the more obvious bugs that wouldn't require testing or a static analyzer to identify. For the remainder of the project, I generally have a good sense of what to test and how to test it, I just didn't have time to execute it.

One thing to call out is that I used the references for basic git knowledge to fork the repo and work locally, but as I was running up against the deadline I ended up just updating my files in GitHub directly and you can see the commit history.

I'm fully fine with accepting whatever consequences this has on my grade since as someone 15+ years into my career I'm here to learn, not to maximize my grades.
