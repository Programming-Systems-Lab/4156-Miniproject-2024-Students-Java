bugs:
1. getCourseLocation() method returns instructorName instead of course location.
2. getInstructorName() method returns couselocation instead of instructor name.

retrieveDepartment() method from RouteContrller class confused two conditions of outputs. When the program finds a given deptcode in the database, it should return HttpStatus.OK instead of HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND.

retrieveCourse() method has similar bug. If the program found the course code, it should return HttpStatus.OK instead of HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN.
